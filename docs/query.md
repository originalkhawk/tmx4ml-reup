`tmx4ml` uses a query syntax mostly compatible with the one used in TMX, while providing useful extensions for better ease of use in a text-only environment.

# Common syntax elements

- **Parameter**: Search parameters are provided using the `param:value` format, where `param` is the name of the option, to which is provided a `value`
- **Parameter list**: Some parameters might accept a list of multiple values, these can be separated using commas.
- **Date**: Dates are provided in the `YYYY-MM-DD` format. Example: `2025-08-25`
- **Time**: Times can be provided using the format `1h1m1s` to indicate hours, minutes and seconds; all of them are optional an can be skipped. Examples: `1m30s`, `20s`.
- **Range**: Ranges are indicated in the `lower-bound...upper-bound` format, with bounds separated by `...`, either of them being optional and can be empty. Examples: `2024-01-01...2024-12-31`, `30s...`.
